# Lane_level_navigation
The project is build to navigate the user the lane in which he/she currently is.
The project is written with the help of octave software and you will need to keep all the files (including code and data files) within a same folder to run it perfectly.

This project is made in collaboration with Nisarg Sheth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nisarg-sheth/?originalSubdomain=in)
